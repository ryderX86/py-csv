# csv_utils.py
Quick-ish & dirty CSV library for Python.

I didn't like the normal library. (I am dumb and cannot understand it so I do not like it)

This is VERY unstable and probably not secure in the slightest
(unless you know EXACTLY what data is coming through here);
this goes without saying but **do not use this if you need security or data integrity**.
