# csv_utils.py
Quick-ish & dirty CSV library for Python.

I didn't like the normal library. (I am dumb and cannot
understand it so I do not like it)

This is VERY unstable and probably will break very often
(unless you're 100% certain the data you're intaking was
cleansed beforehand), this goes without saying but don't
use this if data integrity is a high priority.
